Retry using Resilience4j

here i have implemeneted retry mechanism using resilience4j

when one service is communicating with other service and if other service is slow due to many reasons like :
a)if second service connects to kafka and if kafka s slow
b)if second service is connected with db and db is in other datacenter 
c) is second service is slow due to env traffic issue

then this retry mechanism will help 
here we need to add @retry annottaion 
	@Retry(name= "EmailNotificationService",fallbackMethod="dummyretrymethod")
  dummy fallback method need to be given 
  I am using same services which are used in circuit breaker pattern 
  i have stopped consuming servces and retry attempts will be attempted automatically a/c to properties mentioned 
 
 
 resilience4j.retry.configs.default1.max-retry-attempts=5
resilience4j.retry.configs.default1.wait-duration=10s

each 10sec an attempted will be done automatically to connect to other service and if 5 attempts are done still service is down retryfallback method will be called and response and gets printed 




screenshots will be added in read me file down
